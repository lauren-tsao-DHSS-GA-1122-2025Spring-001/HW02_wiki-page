          Taiyaki (鯛焼き, lit.'baked sea bream') is a Japanese fish-shaped
          cake, commonly sold as street food. It imitates the shape of tai (鯛,
          red sea bream), which it is named after.[1] The most common filling is
          red bean paste that is made from sweetened adzuki beans. Other common
          fillings may be custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato. Some
          shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage
          inside. Smaller, differently shaped versions called kingyoyaki
          (金魚焼き, lit.'baked goldfish') are also available and often sold in
          bags of five, ten, or more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Taiyaki is similar to imagawayaki, which is a thick round cake, also
          filled with sweet adzuki bean paste or custard.

        Taiyaki is made using regular pancake or waffle batter. The batter is
        poured into a fish-shaped mold for each side. The filling is then put on
        one side and the mold is closed. It is then cooked on both sides until
        golden brown.

      <div class="description">
        Taiyaki was first sold in Japan in 1909. It is essentially a reshaped
        form of imagawayaki, an already popular snack made by wrapping bean
        paste in flour skin.
        <p>
          Seijirō Kobe, founder of the store Naniwaya Sōhonten
          (浪花家総本店),[2] was having trouble selling his imagawayaki, so he
          decided to bake the cakes into fish shapes resembling tai, or red sea
          bream. Tai is considered a symbol of luck and fortune in Japan and was
          an expensive fish only affordable by the higher classes or on special
          occasions. Masamori Kobe, the fourth owner of the store, stated that
          Seijirō wanted to give ordinary people a taste of the expensive fish
          at low prices.[3]
        </p>

        <p>
          Since its creation, taiyaki has evolved into many variations, with
          different ingredients being used for filling and batter, as well as
          variations in shapes and sizes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Taiyaki was introduced to Korea during the Japanese colonial period,
          where it is known as bungeo-ppang.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the postwar period, taiyaki spread to other Asian countries, as
          well as the rest of the world.
