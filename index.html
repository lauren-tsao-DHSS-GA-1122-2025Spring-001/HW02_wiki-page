      Shakshouka (Arabic: شكشوكة, romanized: šakšūkah), also spelled shakshuka or chakchouka, is a Maghrebi<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic, commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper. Shakshouka is a popular dish throughout North Africa and the Middle East.<sup>[4]</sup>

          Shakshuka is a word for "mixture" in Algerian Arabic and "mixed" in Tunisian Arabic.<sup>[5][6]</sup> The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as being of multiple origins, an onomatopoeic Maghribi Arabic word, related to the verb shakshaka meaning "to bubble, to sizzle, to be mixed up, to be beaten together," and the French word Chakchouka, which was borrowed into English in the nineteenth century.<sup>[7]</sup> Chakchouka was borrowed into French from Algerian Arabic.<sup>[8]</sup>

          Gil Marks, while noting some similarities with the Ottoman dish
          menemen, suggests that shakshouka evolved from şakşuka which spread to
          the Maghreb through the influence of the Ottoman Empire.<sup>[1]</sup> Anthony
          Buccini noted similarities between a wider range of vegetable stews.
          He and Noam Sienna conclude that both shakshouka and menemen, among
          other dishes like piperade and ratatouille, are members of a wider
          family of vegetable stews of common ancestry appearing throughout the
          western Mediterranean.

          The migration of Maghrebi Jews in the 1950s brought the dish to
          Israel, where it was subsequently widely adopted. The dish was not
          previously present in Palestinian or Levantine cuisine.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
          Shakshouka began appearing in Israeli restaurants in the 1990s.

          Many variations of the basic sauce are possible, varying in spice and
          sweetness. Some cooks add preserved lemon, salty sheep milk cheeses,
          olives, harissa or a spicy sausage such as chorizo or merguez.<sup>[10]</sup>
          Shakshouka is made with eggs, which are commonly poached but can also
          be scrambled, like in the Turkish menemen.

          In Algeria, shakshouka is commonly eaten as a side dish, and there are
          countless variations of it, each with their own unique blend of
          ingredients. One such variation is hmiss, which is often served
          alongside traditional kesra bread. Hmiss typically includes grilled
          peppers, tomatoes, and garlic. In Tunisia, a similar dish called slata
          meshouia is enjoyed, but it differs from hmiss with the addition of
          onions, cumin and tuna.

          In Morocco, there is a dish referred to as bīḍ w-maṭiša (بيض ومطيشة
          "egg and tomato").
        </p>
        <p>
          Some variations of shakshouka can be made with lamb mince, toasted
          whole spices, yogurt and fresh herbs.<sup>[15]</sup> Spices can include ground
          coriander, caraway, paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper.<sup>[16][17]</sup>
          Tunisian cooks may add potatoes, broad beans, artichoke hearts or
          courgettes to the dish.<sup>[18]</sup> The North African dish matbukha can be
          used as a base for shakshouka.

          Because eggs are the main ingredient, it often appears on breakfast
          menus in English-speaking countries, but in the Arab world as well as
          Israel, it is also a popular evening meal,<sup>[20]</sup> and like hummus and
          falafel, is a Levantine regional favorite.[21] On the side, pickled
          vegetables and North African sausage called merguez might be served,
          or simply bread, with mint tea.

          In Jewish culture, a large batch of tomato stew may be made on Friday
          for the Sabbath dinner and the leftovers used on Sunday morning to
          make a breakfast shakshouka with eggs.[12] In Andalusian cuisine, the
          dish is known as huevos a la flamenca; this version includes chorizo
          and serrano ham.[23] In Italian cuisine, there is a version of this
          dish called uova in purgatorio (eggs in purgatory) that adds garlic,
          basil or parsley.
